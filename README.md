# Execution Manual

A knowledge object has not reached its full potential  until it is able to be executed, particularly against applicable data, such as data collected from electronic health records \(EHR\). Throughout this manual, knowledge objects will simply be refereed to as KO.

If you have questions about how KO are created or managed, reference the [Authoring & Managing Knowledge Objects Manual](https://www.gitbook.com/book/kgrid/authoring-ii/details).

An execution stack allows knowledge objects to be executed against collected data. After a public knowledge object has been added to ObjectTeller, other users can "checkout" that object. To "checkout" means to add the knowledge object information to the "shelf". Here we refer to the shelf as a particular user's stack of knowledge objects they would like to execute. Once the knowledge object is added to the shelf, they can be executed with the data through the REST API.

This manual includes information on the process of executing a knowledge object, from adding the KO to the shelf, to executing the KO with your collected data.

The basic steps to execute a knowledge object include \(1\) adding knowledge object to shelf, and \(2\) executing knowledge object with data.

In the "Getting Started" section, we will walk through a basic example of using the execution stack.
