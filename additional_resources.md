**Postman \(**[**https://www.getpostman.com**](https://www.getpostman.com)**\)**

The KGrid team works with Postman as the preferred REST API client. We find Postman simple and rather straight forward to use when utilizing the execution stack. Postman also allows collections of calls that are useful in creating the "smoke tests".
